# Masterthesis-Project

This is the public repository of my Masterthesis project. 

Three branches are relevant to run the examples described in the thesis 

- [x] [Ethereum- main network](https://github.com/Milidrag/Masterthesis-Project/tree/ethereum-mainnet)
- [x] [IOTA- main network](https://github.com/Milidrag/Masterthesis-Project/tree/iota)
- [x] [Polygon- main network](https://github.com/Milidrag/Masterthesis-Project/tree/polygon-mainnet)

The other branches are test branches which have not been subject of the thesis. 

The branches of Ethereum, Polygon and IOTA also contain information how to set up and run the examples in their readme files. 

The VMTrace.txt file contains the path to the VMTrace resolved EVM executed opcodes, provided by blockchain explorer. 

The env file was deleted because of security issues. So you have to create your own env file with the proper key value pairs to run the project. The names of the keys are self explaining in the code like for example API_KEY...
